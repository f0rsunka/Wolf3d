School 21 Project

Simply ray-caster, repeating the main principles of creating game Wolfstein 3D. This project includes rendering walls using raycasting, showing map and move of player, rendering the textures, which you can change pressing on T. Also there is the menu, where described how to control the player and how to use different modes. Modes was added just for fun.
