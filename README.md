School 21 Project

Simply ray-caster, repeating the main principles of creating game Wolfstein 3D. This project includes rendering walls using raycasting, showing map and move of player, rendering the textures, which you can change pressing on T. Also there is the menu, where described how to control the player and how to use different modes. Modes was added just for fun.

How it works?

Runs only on MacOS using graphic library minilibX.
Enter "make" on the command line. You can test different maps: it's name from 0 to 5 and special map named "Pepe". To launch the program, enter "./wolf3d %map_name%" on the command line. Have a good time!
